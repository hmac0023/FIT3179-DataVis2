            <h2>Number of Overweight and Obese Individuals In Australia (2007-2022)</h2>

        </div>

        <div class="analysis">
            <p>Australia has had a steadily increasing issue of obesity and overweightedness in recent years, in which the nation
                has seen a near two time increase in these individuals from 2007 to 2022 (increase from 6.88 million to 12.96 million).
                This has started to become an alarming issue as this is a rapid increase for a 15 year time span and that the greater
                majority of adults (18 years and older) are now classified as overweight and above. Delving into more of the data will
                hopefully give us an understanding of the issue at hand and why figures have trended this way.

            <h2>Self-Assessed Health Distribution</h2>
            <div id="pie_chart1" class="chart-container"></div>
        </div>

        <div class="analysis">
            <p>According to the 2022 national health survey, individuals who were 15 years and older were questioned about how they would
                assess their own personal health. This was measured by giving people the option of choosing a health status from poor to excellent.
                We can see from the above pie chart that the majority of individuals believed that they had good to excellent health, contrary to what
                the data actually depicts. Only 15% of Australians are estimated to consider that their health is not ideal. This could be one of the
                major reasons as to why health figures have trended this way, as people may tend to overestimate their own physical health and thus
                choose not to pursue more physical fitness if they are already content with where they are now.

            <div id="bar_chart" class="chart-container"></div>
        </div>

        <div class="analysis">
            <p>This is further depicted by the above bar chart, as we can clearly see the distribution of individuals' BMI being negatively skewed. 
                We can see a clear discrepancy between individuals who have a recorded BMI of 25 and over compared to those that are within the
                normal range of 18.5 to 24.99.

            <h2>Physical Activity Distribution</h2>
            <div id="pie_chart2" class="chart-container"></div>
        </div>

        <div class="analysis">
            <p>Physical activity is a contributing factor to the obesity problem in Australia, as according to the national health survery for 2022, only 20.8%
                of Australians over 18 years old are estimated to receive adequate physical activity (as measured by the 2014 physical activitiy guildline). 
                This data also shows a clear trend in individuals overestimating their level of physical health as in reality many people fail to meet standard
                requirements of physical activity. Perhaps if people knew their true physical health and sought out action to combat this, there could be a positive
                shift in the current trend of obesity rates.

            <div id="choropleth_map" class="chart-container"></div>
        </div>

        <div class="analysis">
            <p>There are also significant geographic differences in the distribution of overweight and obese individuals across Australian states. 
                We can see that Victoria and New South Wales contain the majority of these individuals considered overweight and obese, followed by
                Queensland and Western Australia. This is most likely because these are the more popular and urbanised states in Australia hence more
                individuals in those areas.
